    "The negative correlation of -0.1 between the acceptance rates of Model 1 and Model 2 suggests a subtle yet noteworthy relationship between acceptance rates and enrollment levels. It implies that universities with lower acceptance rates may attract more applicants, leading to higher enrollment figures. This phenomenon underscores the interplay between competitiveness and enrollment, highlighting the significance of market positioning and enrollment strategies for universities. While maintaining high academic standards is essential, ensuring accessibility and diversity within the student body is crucial for long-term success. Policymakers and education stakeholders should consider the implications of enrollment trends on resource allocation and policy development to address the evolving needs of higher education institutions.\n",

It utilizes geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of universities to calculate distances between them. The scatter plot visualizes the geographical distribution of universities and their enrollment figures, allowing for the identification of clusters or patterns in enrollment. This analysis helps understand whether the proximity of universities influences their enrollment dynamics, potentially leading to insights about competition or collaboration among nearby institutions.\n",
